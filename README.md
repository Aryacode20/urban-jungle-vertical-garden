# Urban Jungle: Vertical Garden from Reused Bottles

## Overview

**Urban Jungle** is a sustainability-focused initiative that aims to upcycle waste plastic bottles into space-efficient vertical gardens. Designed specifically for urban environments where green space is limited, this project promotes environmental awareness, reduces plastic pollution, and offers a simple, low-cost way to beautify and purify living spaces.

This project was ideated as a part of a summer boot camp on **Sustainability and Innovation**. It reflects a commitment to hands-on, impactful, eco-friendly design thinking.


## Problem Statement

Urban areas face a scarcity of greenery due to lack of space, leading to increased pollution, poor air quality, and stressful living conditions. Simultaneously, single-use plastics, especially PET bottles, continue to choke our environment, ending up in landfills or oceans.

There is a clear need for sustainable solutions that tackle both green space deficiency and plastic waste, while being low-cost, accessible, and scalable.



## Project Goal

To design a **modular vertical garden** using **reused plastic bottles**, ideal for small spaces like balconies, rooftops, school walls, or office spaces. This solution should:
- Encourage upcycling and recycling
- Be easy to replicate and maintain
- Serve as a practical environmental education tool
- Improve aesthetic and environmental quality of urban areas



## Concept

The vertical garden consists of:
- **Used plastic bottles** (cut and cleaned)
- **Wall-mounted or frame-mounted layout**
- **Low-maintenance plants** (like money plants, succulents, or herbs)
- **Basic hanging materials** (thread, rope, nails, scissors)

Each bottle acts as a planter. These planters are suspended vertically to create a living wall that’s both functional and beautiful.



## Target Users

- **Urban households** with limited gardening space
- **Educational institutions** promoting eco-awareness
- **NGOs and community centers** for environmental campaigns
- **Offices/co-working spaces** aiming to greenify their environments
- **Students and hobbyists** interested in upcycling and green projects



## How It Helps

- Adds **green cover** in dense areas
- **Purifies air** and lowers temperature around buildings
- Reduces **plastic waste**
- Enhances **visual appeal** of dull urban walls
- Encourages **community engagement** and environmental responsibility



## Implementation Approach

### Materials Needed
- 9–15 plastic bottles (1L or 2L)
- Scissors or cutting tool
- Rope or thick thread
- Wall hooks or a wooden frame
- Potting soil
- Low-maintenance plants

### Steps
1. **Collect & Clean Bottles:** Gather used plastic bottles and wash them thoroughly.
2. **Cut & Prepare:** Cut out openings on each bottle to make planters.
3. **Punch Holes:** Create holes for drainage and for hanging.
4. **Assemble:** Thread rope through the bottles and secure them vertically.
5. **Mount:** Hang on a wall using hooks, or mount the setup on a wooden frame.
6. **Planting:** Fill with soil and plant hardy, low-water plants.



## Timeline

| Week | Activities |
|------|------------|
| 1    | Research + Material Collection |
| 2    | Prototype Design + Cutting Bottles |
| 3    | Assembly + Planting |
| 4    | Testing + Environmental Impact Assessment |
| 5    | Final Presentation + Feedback |



## Components & Tools Required

- Plastic bottles
- Scissors or cutter
- Thick rope or wire
- Nails/hooks
- Drill (optional)
- Plywood (optional for freestanding frame)
- Potting mix
- Hardy plant varieties (e.g., succulents, pothos)



## Skills Needed

- Basic crafting and DIY skills
- Gardening knowledge
- Awareness of environmental sustainability
- Team collaboration (for scaling or educational outreach)
- (Optional) Design tools for layout visualization


## Challenges & Risks

- **Durability:** Long-term exposure to sun/wind might weaken the bottles.
- **Drainage:** Overwatering can lead to leaks or root rot.
- **Maintenance:** Although low, regular watering is still required.
- **Mounting Limitations:** Not every wall may support the weight of a full setup



## Future Enhancements

- Add **automatic drip irrigation** using microcontroller (IoT)
- Use **biodegradable materials** instead of plastic bottles
- Turn into **DIY kits** for schools
- Partner with local waste collectors for bottle sourcing
